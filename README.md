# CustomCamera

Reusable code for adding a custom camera to any app.

This is the source code for the camera being used in my [ongoing project](https://github.com/KrisRJack/turbo-goggles). While this code will run in a simulator, viewing camera preview and capturing photos must be done on a physical device.
